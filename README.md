 * CMS System for Pulling Projects from Github to display on Projects page

### Stack: Angular, Typescript, Asp .NET Core WebAPI (.NET 6.0), Entity Framework

**Concepts Explored:**
- Angular
- Complex CSS Animations
- Figma (used for Graphic Design + Planning Layouts)

### Wait ... you built a portfolio site from scratch? You know there's Website builders, right?

An excellent point! There's definitely a lot of great website builders out there like Wordpress, Wix and another cool one called Weebly which I've used before. But as is my goal of always continually challenging myself and developing new skills, I chose to build my own portfolio site from the ground up. This way, I have 100% flexibility of how it behaves and how it looks, including animations, and I can also link it with a custom backend which I can build myself and make it do whatever I want!


### You mentioned a CMS System?

Yes, actually this is a new idea that I'm going to trial on this project. Basically, I'm going to pull a full list of my projects from Github, and then provide a dashboard for myself to select which projects I want to display on my projects page and also provide additional information or leave stuff out if I want. 

By doing this, I remove the need of having to come back to my site every time I make a new project (trust me, I plan to make a lot more projects in the future!) .. and then I have to write HTML/Frontend code to display them (The complete opposite of fun).

So, I'm going to automate the entire process by making it a simple case of ticking a box to display something, and it makes it look all pretty for me and gives me a nice, consistent layout every time. Pretty neat, right?


...And do I have any clue if this is even going to work or not? Will I achieve gigachad coder status? Or will it be an absolute dumpster fire of "dear god why"? Who knows and who cares! It's all part of the fun!

### Can you make my portfolio work like this?

Let's see how mine works out first ... if it turns out to be a winner, I'll definitely share my knowledge and try and help people when I can! But, watch this space for regular updates!

Here's how it's looking so far!
